Game Demo:																									   
-----------
When you run the file BothModes.py our game will launch.

1) It will start off by showing our cool intro ;)
2) It will ask you to select a game mode whether -pvp(Player vs Player) or single player(Player vs AI)[Which is not intelligent at all tbh(Recommended if you feel you're not so smart(won't change the fact))
3) after that it will ask for your name(s) and salute you.
4) then the round will start.[Player1 will be(X) and player2 will be(O)]
5) The table will get displayed infront of you and in each box there will be a number.
6) To insert your choice you have to select the number of the box you want to fill according to the numbers displayed infront of you.(Obviously, you should choose a box that is not already chosen before)
7) The winner is the one who fills three boxes in a row whether they are horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
8) If there is a winner it will display the winner's name and if there is not, it will display the msg "It's a tie".
9) After that it will display a score board in it is the initials of the 2 players, and under the  winner's initial there will be a point but if it is a tie both players wont get any points.
10) Finally it will ask you if you want to play again.
11) To terminate the program you should write 'n'.
12) Otherwise write 'y' and if so it will restart the whole process starting from point (2).
